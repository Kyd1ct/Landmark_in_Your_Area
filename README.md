# Landmark in your Area

An Android application coded in Java which implements Geofences. It allows users who do not like following specific paths to freely explore their desired location. If they enter the area of a landmark then they will be notified. They can also use the pins on the map to check the landmark's website in a custom browser view. Their visits are logged in a firebase database and the users can easily remove all of the data or specific entries.
